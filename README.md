## About the Book
To construct a system that may be referred to as having ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ it is important to develop the capacity to design algorithms capable of performing data-based automated decision-making in conditions of uncertainty. Now, to accomplish this goal, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of the more sophisticated components of linear algebra, vector calculus, probability, and statistics. This book walks you through every mathematical algorithm, as well as its architecture, its operation, and its design so that you can understand how any artificial intelligence system operates.

This book will teach you the common terminologies used in artificial intelligence such as models, data, parameters of models, and dependent and independent variables. The Bayesian linear regression, the Gaussian mixture model, the stochastic gradient descent, and the backpropagation algorithms are explored with implementation beginning from scratch. The vast majority of the sophisticated mathematics required for complicated AI computations such as autoregressive models, cycle GANs, and CNN optimization are explained and compared.

You will acquire knowledge that extends beyond mathematics while reading this book. Specifically, you will become familiar with numerous AI training methods, various NLP tasks, and the process of reducing the dimensionality of data.
